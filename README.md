## Project Summary

The high-level decision-making strategies for autonomous driving have seen less progress compared to other areas. Itâ€™s because only few use cases are addressed and most of them cannot scale to more complex scenes, when decision-making involves interacting with other human drivers, whose behaviors are uncertain and difficult to model explicitly.  The cost involved in collecting human driving data is very expensive and not possible to record all the possible driving scenarios. The promising approach to achieve this without much hassle is to train a decision-making policy using reinforcement learning. RL leverages driving agent to automatically learn a complex driving policy to imitate the human driving decisions. The goal of our project is to train an autonomous driving agent to drive efficiently by following the safe maneuvers to overtake other driving vehicles in a simulated highway environment. To achieve this, we have implemented two DRL techniques, DQN and DDQN with Dueling Network Architecture which will increase the efficiency of driving agent in a highway environment.
